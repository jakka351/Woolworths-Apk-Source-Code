It's got a really refreshing minty taste that isn't too overpowering, and it doesn't burn or sting like some other mouthwashes I've tried before. I love that it leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh for hours after using it. Plus, it's super easy to use - just swish it around for 30 seconds and you're good to go. I've noticed a real difference in my breath since using it too - no more worrying about bad breath throughout the day. Overall, I'd definitely recommend giving Colgate Plax a try if you're looking for a mouthwash that's effective and easy to use. hdsgfjdhsfg hjdsgf hjdsg fhjdsg fhjdsg fhjdsgfhjdg ", null, "Say goodbye to bad breath with this game-changing mouthwash", composer, 819686838);
